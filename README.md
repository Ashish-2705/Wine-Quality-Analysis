# Wine-Quality-Analysis
Corizo-Major Project- Wine Quality Analysis 

Predict quality of wine using Machine Learning techniques.

Attribute Information:\n",
    # Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):\n",
    
    "1. fixed acidity — primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic.\n",
    "2. volatile acidity — the gaseous acids present in wine.\n",
    "3. citric acid — the weak organic acid found in citrus fruits naturally.\n",
    "4. residual sugar — amount of sugar left after fermentation.\n",
    "5. chlorides — amount of salt present in wine.\n",
    "6. free sulfur dioxide — used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.\n",
    "7. total sulfur dioxide — the portion of SO2 that is free in the wine plus the portion that is bound to other chemicals in the   wine.\n",
    "8. density — the mass per unit volume of wine.\n",
    "9. pH — used for checking acidity.\n",
    "10. alcohol — percent of alcohol present in wine.\n",
    "11. sulphates :    Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.\n",
    
    # Output variable (based on sensory data):\n",
    
    "12. quality"
